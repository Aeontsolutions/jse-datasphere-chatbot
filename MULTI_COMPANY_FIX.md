# Multi-Company Embedding Selection Fix

This directory contains the implementation and tests for fixing the multi-company embedding selection issue.

## Problem Fixed

Previously, when users asked questions mentioning multiple companies (e.g., "How did Access Bank compare to NCB in 2022?"), the `/fast_chat` endpoint would only return documents for the first recognized company that scored highest in the embedding search.

## Solution Implemented

The `semantic_document_selection` function in `fastapi_app/app/utils.py` now:

1. **Extracts companies** from queries using `get_companies_from_query`
2. **Processes each company individually** to find the top 3 relevant documents per company  
3. **Merges and deduplicates** results from all companies
4. **Falls back** to broader search (15 results) when no companies are detected

## Files Changed

- `fastapi_app/app/utils.py` - Main implementation with company-aware document selection
- `fastapi_app/test_multi_company_selection.py` - Comprehensive test suite (5 test cases)
- `fastapi_app/test_chroma_utils.py` - Fixed existing brittle test
- `demo_fix.py` - Demonstration script showing the fix in action
- `test_integration.py` - End-to-end integration test

## Test Results

All tests pass:
- 8 existing tests (unchanged functionality)
- 5 new multi-company tests
- 1 integration test

## Demo

Run `python demo_fix.py` to see the fix in action with a simulated multi-company query.

## Impact

✅ Multi-company queries now return documents for ALL mentioned companies  
✅ Backward compatibility maintained for single-company queries  
✅ Proper fallback behavior when no companies detected  
✅ Deduplication prevents duplicate documents  
✅ Enhanced logging for debugging  

The fix enables proper multi-company comparisons and analysis in the JSE DataSphere Chatbot.
