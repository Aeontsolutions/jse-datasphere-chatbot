# CICD with AWS Copilot

This project is deployed to AWS using the **AWS Copilot CLI**.  Understanding this layout is helpful whenever the assistant is asked questions about "deploy", "environment", or "pipeline".

## Key paths
* Manifests live under `[copilot/](mdc:copilot)`; the main service is the load-balanced web service at `[copilot/api/manifest.yml](mdc:copilot/api/manifest.yml)`.
* Each environment has its own CloudFormation stack automatically managed by Copilot.

## Environments
* **test** – the staging playground. Deployed with `copilot env deploy --name test` and updated via `copilot svc deploy --name api --env test`.
* **prod** – the live production environment.  Once created (`copilot env init --name prod`), promote by redeploying the same image/tag to prod:  `copilot svc deploy --name api --env prod --tag <sha>`.

## Typical workflow
1. Develop locally → commit.
2. Deploy to *test*:
   ```bash
   AWS_PROFILE=jse-datasphere-elroy copilot svc deploy --name api --env test
   ```
3. Validate in test (`/health`, `/chat`, etc.).
4. Promote to *prod* (same tag or rebuild):
   ```bash
   AWS_PROFILE=jse-datasphere-elroy copilot svc deploy --name api --env prod --tag <sha>
   ```

## Pipelines
* A Copilot CodePipeline can be generated with `copilot pipeline init` placing files in `[copilot/pipelines/](mdc:copilot)` (none committed yet).
* Pipeline stages usually map **Source → Build → deploy to test → manual approval → deploy to prod**.

## Tips & conventions
* The ALB URLs differ per environment; use custom `alias` entries in `manifest.yml` to give stable domain names.
* Keep secrets out of the manifest—store in AWS Secrets Manager and reference via the `secrets:` block.
* Use `copilot svc logs`, `copilot svc status`, and `copilot svc show` to debug deployments.

When questions about deployment, CI/CD, environment promotion, or AWS credentials arise, reference this rule.
