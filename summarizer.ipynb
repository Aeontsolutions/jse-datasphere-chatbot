      "    -   Move away from operating a full-time online school (EduFocal Academy).\n",

      "-   **Alignment with prior financial results or guidance**: While revenue showed slight growth ($187M vs $185M in 2021), the company swung to a significant net loss (-$178.8M) compared to a profit in 2021 ($8.7M). This was primarily driven by the large ($153M) impairment charge on receivables, indicating a major deviation from prior performance and likely expectations post-IPO. Q4 revenue growth was lower than expected due to project delays.\n",
      "-   **Notable changes in strategy, tone, or risk profile**: Key changes include the acquisition of Clever School Teacher, the discontinuation of EduFocal Academy, a stated focus on African expansion, the significant impairment charge highlighting credit risk issues, the resulting increase in debt and finance costs, and the proposed capital raise (Rights Issue). The risk profile has increased due to the high debt, negative equity (on a consolidated basis per financials, though parent company equity is positive), and challenges with receivables.\n",
      "-   **Items to monitor in future disclosures**:\n",
      "    -   Progress on collecting aged receivables and any potential reversals of the impairment charge.\n",
      "    -   Updates on the Nigerian market entry and other international expansion efforts.\n",
      "    -   Performance and integration of the Clever School Teacher acquisition.\n",
      "    -   Tangible results from the reorganization exercise (cost savings, efficiency improvements).\n",
      "    -   Status and impact of the proposed Stock Split and Rights Issue (capital raised, use of proceeds).\n",
      "    -   Management of the high debt level and associated finance costs.\n",
      "    -   Revenue and profitability trends in 2023, particularly the contribution from delayed 2022 projects.\n",
      "    -   Cash flow generation and management.\n",
